/*
The architecture here is based on a variant of BEM methodology with namespaces, 
inspired by Zell Liew - more information can be found here: https://zellwk.com/blog/css-architecture-2/
This architecture worked for me very well on multiple projects, but please note that I am happy to 
employ any other method of organising SCSS.
