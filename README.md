# frontend-assignment
This repo contains javascript assignments which are tested for correctness but not for method. It also contains a design assignment based on HTML & SCSS.

### Starting
The assignment begins from reading this README. We expect you to have a base understanding of standard web development principles, including git and npm/yarn.
We also believe in documenting our code properly, this project is not an exception.

* Clone this repo, and open the directory in terminal
* Create a new branch titled `assignment-firstname-lastname`
* Install the project dependencies with yarn (or npm) `yarn install`
* Open the project, complete the `tasks` and run `yarn test` to see your progress

### Contents of repo
* `tasks` contains the tasks you need to complete
* `test` contains the test modules to verify the tasks work. You can ignore this.

### Expectations
I don't want you to spend hours and hours on these assignments, and it's purely to help us understand where you are technically and how you think. The requirements below are guidelines. Nothing has to be fully complete or totally working for us to make an offer, even leaving a comment saying how you'd approach a problem is great.

* `Interns`: `tasks/web` and `tasks/01` are "must submit". Anything else is a bonus.
* `Junior`: `tasks/web` and `tasks/01`, `tasks/02` are "must submit".
* `Medior`: `tasks/web` and `tasks/01`, `tasks/02` and one of `03`, `04`, or `05` are "must submit".
* `Senior`: `tasks/web` and `03`, `04`, and `05` are "must submit". Explanations into the methods and clear documentation are highly valued. You'd be expected to coach more junior team members.

**NOTE: Doing something above the job level you're applying for doesn't guarantee we'll place you at that level or make you an offer for a job at that level**
