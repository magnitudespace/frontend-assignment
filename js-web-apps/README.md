# frontend-assignment - JS / Web Apps

### Introduction
The follow task is a chance for you to show us your technical knowledge and problem solving methods.

There aren't any hidden tricks here, we want to see how you approach problems and what the quality of you code is.

Please address all the requirements. There are some levels of ambiguity, this is intentional - but there isn't a right/wrong answer to areas of ambiguity.

It's fine if you go above and beyond, but please don't feel like you need too. We want to see a simple, focused, and well-executed project.

### Task description
A lot of our web platforms are about consuming APIs and displaying data in a visually pleasing manner.

Using either Vue or React (we want to see your code, not your competence in a specific framework) and a styling approach of your choice (eg. CSS, SASS, PostCSS) write a tiny app that takes an API endpoint (see dev notes).

We want to see you take the data from the endpoint and display it on a map with a color scale and key for the intensity of the carbon emissions.

### Dev Notes
API endpoint: https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/#get-regional-regionid-regionid

Please do *not* use any component libraries.

### Acceptance criteria
- Data for the currently half hour from the carbon intensity endpoint is visualized on a map
- Tests; How would you test this? (Cypress, Ava, Jest, Mocha, or whichever framework you see as best fit)
- Creativity; Add some styling (optionally in the style of the homepage, hiber.global)
- *Optionally*; any other interesting functionality

### Output
Commit your code to a GitHub repo and share the repo with me. (GitHub username is `nothingrandom`).
Bonus; add it to a CI/CD tool like Netlify and add the link to your repo.

Thanks. Best of luck!
